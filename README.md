Dragon Real Estate - Price Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting real estate prices using various features of the housing data. This project utilizes data processing techniques, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to create a robust model for predicting house prices.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Data Loading and Exploration: Initial data loading and basic exploration to understand the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and ensuring data quality.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting important features for the model.
Model Training: Training various machine learning models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using test data and various evaluation metrics.
Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Data
The dataset used in this project includes various features of houses such as:

CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black residents by town
LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

Results
The model has been evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The final model provides a good balance between bias and variance and makes accurate predictions on the test set.
